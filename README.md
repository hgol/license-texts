# Half-Gray Open Licenses (Legal Texts)

This repository contains the legal texts of the [Half-Gray Open Licenses](http://halfgray.tk/licenses).

## Format

The texts are written using [Mmark](https://mmark.nl/) (version 1), an extension of Markdown that adds syntax for different types of lists (numbers, letters, and Roman numerals), among other things. Version 1, as currently used in Hugo, must be used, as version 2 of Mmark removed this list syntax.

## Note About "Released Versions"

The versions in this repository are *not* "Released Versions" as defined in the licenses because they do not have an identifying version number. Although the version tags represent identical content to the Released Versions, they are not Released Versions themselves. Released Versions are published only on the website.

## License

The license texts are released into the public domain under [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). A copy is available in `LICENSE.txt`.
