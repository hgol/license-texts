# Half-Gray Open Licenses (Legal Texts)

This repository contains the legal texts of the [Half-Gray Open Licenses](http://halfgray.tk/licenses).

## Format

The texts are written using [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), which includes an extension that adds syntax for different types of ordered lists (numbers, letters, and Roman numerals).

## Note About "Released Versions"

The versions in this repository are *not* "Released Versions" as defined in the licenses because they do not have an identifying version number. Although the version tags represent identical content to the Released Versions, they are not Released Versions themselves. Released Versions are published only on the website.

## License

The license texts are released into the public domain under [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). A copy is available in `LICENSE.txt`.
